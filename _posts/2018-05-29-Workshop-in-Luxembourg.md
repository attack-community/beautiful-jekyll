## MITRE ATT&CK - an intensive 2-day workshop in Luxembourg

On 24-25 May 2018, over 40 participants met at C3 (the Cybersecurity Competence Center) in Luxembourg to discuss how MITRE ATT&CK™ can help strengthen cyber defense . The participants hailed
 from over 30 different organizations, ranging from national CERTs to financial sector organizations to cybersecurity vendors. Despite their differences in country of origin, sector, and background, attendees came together with a common goal of sharing how ATT&CK can be used in practice. The group found value about hearing each other’s use cases and think it would be valuable t
o continue the conversation.

Next meeting is foreseen the Friday 19th October 2018 after [hack.lu 2018](https://2018.hack.lu/).

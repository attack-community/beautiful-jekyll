# About the ATT&CK community

The ATT&CK community a diverse community of practitioners including security professionals, cybersecurity vendors, CSIRTs/CERTs and organisations whose aim is to actively use MITRE ATT&CK™ while contributing back to improve cyber defense. The ATT&CK community is a vendor neutral platform where all users can discuss, exchange and improve their use of adversary tactics and techniques together in practical use cases like attribution, prevention, detection, hunting and response.

# History

On 24-25 May 2018, over 40 participants met at C3 (the Cybersecurity Competence Center) in Luxembourg to discuss how MITRE ATT&CK™ can help strengthen cyber defense . The participants hailed from over 30 different organizations, ranging from national CERTs to financial sector organizations to cybersecurity vendors. Despite their differences in country of origin, sector, and background, attendees came together with a common goal of sharing how ATT&CK can be used in practice. The group found value about hearing each other’s use cases and think it would be valuable to continue the conversation.

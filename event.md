# Monday-Tuesday 18-19 May 2020 - EU ATT&CK Community workshop in Brussels

The fifth EU ATT&CK Community workshop will take place at the European Commission on 18 and 19 May 2020 from 9am until 5pm. The workshop is organised by practitioners and for practitioners with an interest in the use of the MITRE ATT&CK Framework in Prevention, Detection/Hunting and Response. No press or sales people in the room.This will be the biggest MITRE ATT&CK conference ever, with more than 400 seats available. There will be plenty of networking opportunity as well. 

In this workshop you will hear updates from MITRE and from the developers of community systems and tools supporting the ATT&CK Framework. But even more importantly, you will learn best practices from your peers in the user community. 

The two day workshop will be packed with presentations by practitioners on how they apply the MITRE ATT&CK Framework in their environment. At the third workshop in Brussels there were 45 such presentations. And if there is sufficient interest we will also organise hands on seminars on the tools available (Navigator, SIGMA).

Participation to this event is at no cost for the participants, but registration is required. The link to register for this event will be made available in December 2019. 

The presentations from the fourth community workshop in Luxembourg in October 2019 are available on the following link:

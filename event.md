You can already save the date for the fifth workshop, on 18-19 May 2020 in Brussels. This will be a two day workshop packed with presentations by practitioners on how they apply the MITRE ATT&CK Framework in their environment. At the third workshop in Brussels there were 45 such presentations. There will also the opportunity to have in depth discussions on specific themes. And if there is sufficient interest we will also organise hands on seminars on the tools available (Navigator, SIGMA).

subtitle: Fifth EU ATT&CK Community Workshop
---
# Monday-Tuesday 18-19 May 2020

The fifth EU ATT&CK Community Workshop has taken place on 18 and 19 May 2020, as a virtual event. The event was very successful, with more than 1800 individual attendees joining from 76 countries. We had between 500 and 800 participants online at any time during the two days.  

The agenda was packed with inspiring, useful and stimulating content, with updates from MITRE and from the developers of community systems and tools supporting the ATT&CK Framework and SIGMA. There were also very interesting presentations of best practices from the user community and different perspectives of the use of the Framework. There were also hands-on sections on some of the tools available (Navigator, SIGMA, DETT&CT etc.).

The presentations with their respective Q&A as well as the results of the poll done during the breaks are available on the following link:

# Next EU ATT&CK Community Workshop

The sixth workshop will take place on 23 October, hosted by CIRCL. It will most likely be a virtual event again. The opening of the registrations will be announced on social media and via the EU ATT&CK Community mailing list. 

# About the EU ATT&CK Community

The EU ATT&CK Community is a diverse community of practitioners including security professionals, cybersecurity vendors, CSIRTs/CERTs and user organisations whose aim is to actively use MITRE ATT&CK™ while contributing back to improve cyber defense. The EU ATT&CK Community is a vendor neutral platform where all users can discuss, exchange and improve their use of adversary tactics and techniques together in practical use cases like attribution, prevention, detection, hunting and response.

# Monday-Tuesday 18-19 May 2020 - EU ATT&CK Community Workshop

The fifth EU ATT&CK Community Workshop will take place on 18 and 19 May 2020 from 1pm CET until 7pm CET. This time it will be organised as a virtual event, by videoconference, in view of the current travel restrictions. The Workshop is organised by practitioners and for practitioners with an interest in the use of the MITRE ATT&CK Framework in Prevention, Detection/Hunting and Response. There will be no press participation or sales pitches.  

In this virtual Workshop you will hear updates from MITRE and from the developers of community systems and tools supporting the ATT&CK Framework. But even more importantly, you will learn best practices from your peers in the user community. The workshop will be packed with presentations by practitioners on how they apply the MITRE ATT&CK Framework in their environment. There will also be hands on sections on the tools available (Navigator, SIGMA etc.).

Participation to this event is at no cost for the participants, but registration is required. The link to register for this event is:

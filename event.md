|    |            | Threat intelligence sharing in the IT world is common. It uses tools like STIX or TAXII for threat description and sharing and MITRE ATT&CK for attack modelling. While MITRE has been recently extended by the BHADRA framework, there are still many challenges for telco threat intelligence sharing. We will describe, what the key issues and missing elements are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |            |              |                |                             |

|    |            | Converting your knowledge of the threat landscape into intelligence the C-suite cares about is sometimes difficult.However, having a good understanding of your key stakeholders’ concerns is paramount when communicating the cyber threat landscape. By using the DIRECTION & PLANNING stage of the Intelligence Cycle you can communicate intelligence that is relevant and support your C-Suite's key decision points. This is where ATT&CK tactics and techniques become less relevant, and where common knowledge, your specific knowledge about your environment and your intelligence process come into play.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |            |              |                |                             |

|    |            | As ransomware attacks have grown more sophisticated, they have also become more customized. Each victim is different, so skilled ransomware actors have to customize their attack to the network. This type of customization takes time, often several days, weeks and, in some cases, months. That gives defenders an opportunity to conduct hunt missions for ransomware actors that may have bypassed initial defenses and are moving around the network, gaining access to privilege accounts and exfiltrating critical data. By mapping this threat hunting mission to the ATT&CK framework your organization can effectively understand the progress of the ransomware attack and stop the threat actors before they have a chance to steal your organization's valuable data and encrypt your systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |            |              |                |                             |

|    |            | Many threat intelligence teams have seen great value from tracking what adversaries are doing using ATT&CK. This helps us prioritize where to focus our defensive efforts based on what threats are doing. However, deciding how to do that tracking can be a difficult task for analysts. In this talk, Katie will share how her team has struggled through multiple iterations and formats for tracking adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures. She will give advice to help others doing this kind of tracking and share the powerful analysis that is possible as a result of the methodology her team chose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |            |              |                |                             |

|    |            | We have been jointly working  at extending the mapping of the MITRE framework to cover some aspects of E-crime. The current MITRE framework already has a draft of ATT&CK for Fraud, but this can be significantly extended to cover other mechanisms for fraud. In this talk we will report our research in expanding the MITRE ATT&CK framework to cover banking malware techniques observed in the wild. Once the research is concluded we hope to share the information back with the community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |            |              |                |                             |

|    |            | In a threat landscape that is becoming increasingly sophisticated and polymorphic, the importance of understanding the enemy and its modus operandi for anticipatory threat reduction is apparent. Even though the way we describe and share technical indicators for informing our defense components tend to become a mature, standardized process, higher-level information such as threat actor context is nonuniform, unstructured, and ambiguous, making it difficult to operationalize it and correlate with different sources for deriving more accurate and relevant intelligence.   In this talk, we will make evident how commonly agreed controlled vocabularies for characterizing threat actors and their operations can be used to enrich cyber threat intelligence and infer new information at a higher contextual level that is explicable and queryable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |            |              |                |                             |

|    |            | This talk is intended to share an approach taken by FCERT to measure ransomware resilience in which an organization’s security controls are mapped against the Mitre ATT&CK framework and Cyber Kill chain. FCERT.NL is an intel collaboration initiative between three large banks in the Netherlands to support the Dutch Financial Community. Its goal is to deliver intelligence to enable proactive threat mitigation and increased awareness of the cyber threat landscape. FCERT’s Ransomware Resilience Matrix is intended to provide insight into the most common ransomware threat vectors across the organization and its controls, which often are under the responsibility of different departments. It provides a tool enabling a central view crossing perimeter, network, endpoint, data and governance controls and offers a steering mechanism for the status of ransomware resilience and where to prioritise based on any identified gaps.

|    |            | After years of using ATT&CK, we have seen some good and not so good experiences on the application of the framework, both personally and from the community. There are lot of organizations implementing ATT&CK for quite some time but not seeing the positive results promised. There are multiple reasons why this is happening.

|    |            | DLL Hijacking (part of T1574) is a popular technique for executing malicious payloads. Attackers have been seen to use different types of DLL hijacking in order to trick legitimate binaries into executing their malicious commands. In this talk, the different kinds of DLL hijacking are discussed, including examples of how they've been used in the wild. We will show how you can identify a binary is vulnerable to DLL hijacking (hello red teamers!) as well as how you can detect DLL hijacking effectively and efficiently (hello blue teamers and threat hunters!).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |            |              |                |                             |

During this session we will walk through our Detection Engineering Program, to detail how MITRE ATT&CK Framework is adopted and continuously used to assess and scale up our detections. While an in house built Cyber Analytics Repository is using Sigma and Yara rules for detections write-ups, we leverage MaGMa Framework for Use Case Management and DeTT&CT Framework for Detections Gap Assessment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |            |              |                |                             |

|    |            | During this talk, you will learn how to leverage the MITRE ATT&CK framework for Cyber Resilience. While the ATT&CK framework is very popular amongst cybersecurity pros, it is not common to take an adversary (MITRE-based) approach towards recovery and architecture - which could be seen as a further career advancement opportunity for incident response and threat hunting analysts. The talk will go through the concepts of High Value Assets and how the MITRE Impact Tactics (TA0040) can be mapped to the NIST 800-160 guidelines. The attendees will learn that while focusing on TIDs and day-to-day operations is paramount, taking a step back and embedding Cyber Resilience concepts into the way how threat management organizations onboard architecture and projects is equally important. The key takeaway will be a ready-to-apply set of guidelines and model for allowing blue and red teams on Cyber Resilience.                                                                                                                                                                                  |            |              |                |                             |

|    |            | The MITRE ATT&CK Framework is a great resource to prioritize the deployment of detection and prevention controls. However, without a proper controls validation strategy, security teams can fall into a false sense of coverage. In this lighting talk I will introduce you to PurpleSharp, an open source adversary simulation tool that can help teams validate security controls in an automated way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |            |              |                |                             |


# Fifth EU MITRE ATT&CK® Community Workshop

The fifth EU MITRE ATT&CK® Community Workshop has taken place on 18 and 19 May 2020, as a virtual event. The event was very successful, with more than 1800 individual attendees joining from 76 countries. We had between 500 and 800 participants online at any time during the two days.  The event was co-hosted and strongly supported by <a href="https://mitre-engenuity.org/">MITRE Engenuity's Center for Threat-Informed Defense</a>.  

The agenda was packed with inspiring, useful and stimulating content, with updates from MITRE and from the developers of community systems and tools supporting the ATT&CK framework and SIGMA. There were also very interesting presentations of best practices from the user community and different perspectives of the use of the framework. There were also hands-on sections on some of the tools available (ATT&CK Navigator, CALDERA™, SIGMA, DeTT&CT etc.).

The presentations with their respective Q&A are available on the following link:

The EU ATT&CK Community is a diverse community of cybersecurity practitioners including researchers, vendors, CSIRTs/CERTs and user organisations whose aim is to actively use MITRE ATT&CK™ while contributing back to improve cyber defense. The EU ATT&CK Community is a vendor neutral platform where all participants can discuss, exchange and improve their use of adversary tactics and techniques together in practical use cases like attribution, prevention, detection, hunting and response.

The EU ATT&CK Community was set up in agreement with MITRE but it is not operated by MITRE and the content of these webpages are not specifically endorsed by MITRE.
